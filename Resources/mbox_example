Subject: [PATCH] another patch

Here is a patch from A U Thor.  This addresses the issue raised in the
message:

From: Nit Picker <nit.picker@example.net>
Subject: foo is too old
Message-Id: <nitpicker.12121212@example.net>

Hopefully this would fix the problem stated there.


I have included an extra blank line above, but it does not have to be
stripped away here, along with the               		   
whitespaces at the end of the above line.  They are expected to be squashed
when the message is made into a commit log by stripspace,
Also, there are three blank lines after this paragraph,
two truly blank and another full of spaces in between.

            

Hope this helps.
